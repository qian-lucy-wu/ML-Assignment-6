Use the data in Transaction.csv 

Submit your writeup and code in one R Markdown document and a HTML file..

Provide evidence to support your answers.

 

1. [10 points] PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is an unsupervised ML method that is often used to reduce dimensionality of large data sets.

1.1 Please explain how PCA can be used to reduce the number of variables.

1.2 Please highlight limitations of PCA.
 

2. [40 points] Trees are supervised algorithms that can be used for both regression and classification tasks. For the following trees, please explain how it is grown (i.e., how to select the variables to split on at each node)

2.1 Classification Tree

2.2 Regression Tree
 

3. [10 points] Please explain how a tree is pruned?
 

4. [10 points] Please explain why a Random Forest usually outperforms regular regression methods (such as linear regression, logistic regression, and lasso regression).
 

5. [30 points] Use the Trasaction.csv dataset to create payment default classifier ('payment_default ' column) and explain your output using:

5.1 Classification Tree (CART)

5.2 Random Forest
